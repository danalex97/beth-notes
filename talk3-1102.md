### Distributed Ledger System

- distributed ledgers: a distributed record of transactions
- consensus network: gets same view of distributed ledger
- actors: talk to the consensus network(e.g. wallet)

- smart contracts: adding code onto the distributed ledger

### Conceptual Architecture:
  - real world: actions
  - digital world: distributed ledgers, consensus network, tokens

  - token values lie into the conceptual architecture components
     - e.g. need of token for interacting with the system
  - incentive mechanism:
      - **for miners:** to give intrinsic value
      - **for actors:** creating new tokens, e.g. planting a tree may create tokens

### Cryptoeconomics

- take 1: trust trust mechanism
- take 2: token design(e.g. incetives for actors)

### Implications

- elimination of trusted intermediaries

### Delusions
  - anonymity: e.g. if the wallet stands on Amazon, the transactions are public
  - decentralization: e.g. 70% BitCoin miners in China, Ripple doesn't allow anyone to mine
  - trust: e.g. hacking of the system

### Consensus

- **definition**: the act of writing entries to the distributed ledger

- components:
  - hash function
  - block structure: i.e. the chaining
  - proof-of-work: challenge f(block) < **00000** 1000..

### [Taxonomy](http://bloxonomy.space)
  - Who can do transactions?
  - How is proof of work done?
  - How tokens get created?
