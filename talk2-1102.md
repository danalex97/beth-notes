## Exponential Climate Action

- motivation: need of exponential decarbonization via technology and regulation
  - e.g. why are regulations important? we need to provide economic incetives
  - e.g. sustainability - climate dividend: crisis in France from taxing carbon usage directly

- [Cleantech21](http://cleantech21.org), [Hack4Climate](http://hack4climate.org)
- **decentralization macro trend:** energy(e.g. solar), mobility(e.g. car co-ownership), etc.

### Focus Technologies
  - IoT:
     - more devices capture more data
     - we need an decentralized distribution way
  - DLT(ledgers)
     - administer and exchange data
  - AI
     - need to 'learn' from data but in a distributed way to avoid monopolies
     - feed back into IoT for acting

### Selber
  - central: bottom up renewable energy, i.e. better energy use per household
  - energy-innovation waves:
     - distributed generation: e.g. solar power
     - distributed storage: e.g. batteries get cheaper
     - integration: e.g. roof with integrated solar cells
     - IoT,DLT,AI
  - sharing markets: e.g. community-buildings
  - grid management: default automatic, overridable
  - regulation importance: making bottom-up profitable only if network tariffs properly regulated
  - roll-out challenges: distributed ledgers may consume too much(e.g. Ethereum) or may process too slow(e.g. [iota](https://www.iota.org/))
