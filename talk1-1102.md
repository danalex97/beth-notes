- data increases faster(doubles/12 month) than processing power(doubles/18 months)

### Blockchain - issues and solutions
  - issues:
    - energy efficiency
    - over-regulation
    - over-commercialization
    - one dimensional money system

  - possible solutions:
    - energy efficiency
       - rather use a part of the network for consensus
       - use trust mechanisms
    - over-commercialization
       - open source data & code
       - to obtain competitive advantage, open-source after some time

### Sustainability example: traffic jams
 - real-time feedback: change interaction mechanism
    - e.g. limiting the incoming flow of cars
 - increase decentralization
    - e.g. add more nodes to make traffic more fluid
    - e.g. crises mapping, disaster response via decentralized IoT systems

**General principle:** create incentives for sustainability
