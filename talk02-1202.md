### Incentives

- *an economy, not an app*
   - people can use tokens in any way(e.g. can take tokens away) ⇨ less control

### Cryptoeconomic Design

- **cryptography** to prove properties about messagaes in paset
- **economic incentives** to encourage a certain user

- relevant actors:
  - miner: miners need to care about mining to run the blockchain
  - actor: actors need to use the system

- applications:
  - governance models:
    - prediction markets:
      - use wisdom of the crowd for creating predictions
      - people use tokens to bet on outcomes
    - curation markets:
      - more effective coordination
- experiments: DAO, artificial life forms(e.g. think of GainForest)

- importance: power over people in system

- parameters:
  - control: who?
  - choice: is it mandatory? (e.g. Chine government)
  - governance: process for changing the CED

### Single-token vs. Multi-token

- token can represent:
  - money
  - reputation
  - sustainability score
  - experience(e.g. StackExchange)
- multiple tokens:
  - one token ⇨ probably bad
  - centralized ⇨ probably bad
  - can't opt out  ⇨ probably bad
  - etc.
