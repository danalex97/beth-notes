# Challenges in Technology Commercialization

#### Technology push:
   - technologies are often developed before a market application(i.e. are in need for a "customer problem")
   - e.g. senseFly application in agriculture
     - translate specs into why is tech useful for customers
     - usually long term business time frames(plan for 5-10 years)


#### Market and Tech risk
  - tech uncertainty  
  - demand uncertainty

#### Typical challenges
   - **Productization challenge:** how do I create a product?
      - identify market applications
      - evaluate product-market combinations
      - decide on go-to-market strategy
      - technological and product design
   - **Appropriation challenge:** what is the business model?
      - IP strategy to protect freedom to operate
        - patent protection useful for cheap-to-imitate ideas
        - e.g.  Tesla "open-source", SpaceX no patents
      - identify and implement operations that deliver profitable & sustainable revenue
      - secure initial founding
   - Organization challenge: how we organize a team?

#### High-end to Low-end approach
  - examples: Tesla, Dartfish
  - **start with high-end market**: e.g. professional athletes
  - **lower-end with cheaper version**: e.g. semi-professional athletes
	 - this may drive some high-end market users to the cheaper version

#### Selling products and offering consultancy
  - advantage: building customers early
  - disadvantage: locks you into a business model that provides consultancy
